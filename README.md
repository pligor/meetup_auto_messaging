Load the members list from a specific Meetup group
Filter out excluded members (if any)
Extract the first name of each member for personalization
Send a custom message to each member by simulating keystrokes and clicks

Handle errors and retry sending messages if necessary

Python 3.x
Selenium WebDriver
